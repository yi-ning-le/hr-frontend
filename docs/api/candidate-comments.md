## Implementation Notes
- **Author Identity:** The backend should derive `authorId`, `authorName`, and `authorRole` from the authenticated session/JWT token.
- **Ordering:** Comments should ideally be returned in descending order of `createdAt` to match the Twitter-style UI requirements.
- **Permissions:** 
  - Only HR and assigned Interviewers should be able to post/view comments.
  - Users should only be able to delete their own comments (or Admin/HR can delete any if required by policy).
